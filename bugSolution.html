The issue was resolved by ensuring the Tailwind directives were included correctly in the `style` tag or imported correctly into the project, and that there were no conflicting styles overriding the gradient classes. 
Here's a corrected version:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Tailwind Gradient Fix</title>
  <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tailwindcss@2.2.19/dist/tailwind.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body class="bg-gray-100">
  <div class="container mx-auto p-4">
    <div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
      This div now correctly displays the gradient background.
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```

Ensure your Tailwind configuration is correctly set up and that there are no conflicting styles.  Properly importing Tailwind and avoiding conflicts with other CSS is crucial for this to function reliably.
