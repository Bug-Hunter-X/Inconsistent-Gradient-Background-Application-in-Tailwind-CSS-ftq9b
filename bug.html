The following Tailwind CSS classes are not applied correctly:

```html
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500">
  This div should have a gradient background.
</div>
```

The expected output is a div with a gradient background from blue to purple. However, the actual output is a div with a plain blue background.  This happens inconsistently and only on certain components.
