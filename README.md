# Inconsistent Gradient Background Application in Tailwind CSS

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS gradient backgrounds are not applied consistently across components.  The gradient sometimes works as expected, and other times only the starting color is displayed.

## Bug Description

The `bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500` class is expected to create a gradient background transitioning from blue to purple. However, in certain instances, only a solid blue background is rendered. This behavior is inconsistent and not easily reproducible.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in your browser.
3. Observe the inconsistent application of the gradient background on different divs. Note that sometimes the gradient is correctly displayed, while at other times it is not.

## Potential Causes

* **CSS Specificity:** Conflicting CSS rules may be overriding the Tailwind CSS classes.
* **Order of Classes:** The order of classes in the HTML might affect the application of the gradient.
* **Plugin Conflicts:**  Conflicting plugins or custom CSS may interfere with Tailwind's functionality.
* **Build Process:** Issues during the build process could lead to incorrect CSS generation.

## Solution (bugSolution.html)

The solution often involves carefully reviewing CSS specificity, ensuring correct class ordering, and resolving any plugin conflicts.  A possible fix could involve using more specific selectors to ensure Tailwind's classes are applied correctly.  The `bugSolution.html` file demonstrates a possible fix.
